title = "about martian"
+++

martian is a retro-ish Zola theme from the Red Planet.

# "Retro-ish"

This theme stays lightweight and minimizes the use of `<div>`s, overly complex
CSS, and Javascript. It seeks to replicate the look-and-feel and simplicity of
older (1900s to 2000s) websites, while taking advantage of newer web browsers
and display hardware with pretty fonts (Ubuntu and Mononoki).

# Why "martian?"

Because my (Marceline) name is Mars, so a Zola theme made by me would be
Martian.

# Freely Licensed

This theme uses the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0) because
free, libre, and open-source software will save the world. How does the AGPL-3.0
license apply to something like HTML templates? I don't know. You figure it out.
Just keep the modifications to the theme free and open.
